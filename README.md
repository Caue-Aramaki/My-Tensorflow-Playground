# My-Tensorflow-Playground
Tensorflow exercises with Google Colab, with the use of the tutorial videos from Daniel Bourke https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/tree/main/video_notebooks

This is merely for personal use, and it is free for anyone to look at it.

Most of the codes will look similar but sucint in relation to the codes from Bourke.
